					        The new look involved a rebranding of the site to unify the various materials that were 
					        being distributed to subscribers. The blue-green accent was used to produce a simple and 
					        elegant open book logo, its pages open and ready to share with the audience. The site 
					        itself adopted a minimalistic approach with a mix of greys, whites and drop shadows to 
					        produce depth while allowing the content of the site to produce much of the 'look and feel'.

					        A big push for the site was to build on the fantastic community that had been built 
					        using social media. The <em>Write Chain Challenge</em>, where a target is set and links are 
					        created each day encourages small acheivable goals. A custom Perch add-on was written 
					        to allow easy management of the score board - the avatars providing a sense of continuity
					        between the Twitter following and the website.

				        The site navigation was carefully considered and a new page tree was developed with the client. 
				        Moving away from the confusing nested pages of the previous site key areas were identified
				        and moved to a clear navigation at the top of the page.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        Secondary links are contextual, being displayed on a per-page basis.

                            Under the hood the site uses modern CSS design, breaking the UI 
                            into components and organising style code amongst layers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Developed in Sass the user interface is fully modular with modifier classes
                            setting any additional styles or indicating state - such as the example above.
                            This allows a developer to easily add additional pages or UI elements as the 
                            site evolves.
