                            Julie Makes Cakes has been through several evolutions, initially focusing on cupcakes and parties 
                            the audience has grown to include formal and large scale events such as weddings, anniversaries 
                            and other family celebrations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The brief was to simplify the site to the three core products and improve the ordering process. 
                            The previous iteration had focused on being a portfolio, with many pages of photographs and 
                            decorative options. Customers often used alternative channels such as Facebook rather than the site itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this in mind the site was designed to channel users to one of three landing pages which provide visitors
                            with pricing, flavours and a quote form. Further pages are available with additional information but these
                            do not form the 'core' of the site.

                        To avoid the landing pages appearing the same the templates are designed to be modular. 
                        Each row can be arranged within the CMS giving the client incredible control over their page 
                        layouts without needing any technical knowledge. The wavy edges mimick icing to give the
                        appearance of layered cake tiers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The client has used this to great effect creating a wonderful stacked page full of 
                        information and delicious photography.

					        As part of the rebuild the brading was revisited. The goal was to reduce the intensity providing
					        a more elegant feel to the site. The target audience of the new site was to cater for weddings, 
					        pastel shades and serif typefaces were chosen to provide a softer and more traditional experience
					        for visitors.
					    </p>
					    
					    <p>
					        Carrying this across to social media was very important as this was a major traffic source. 
					        Matching business cards, social network graphics and other assets were produced and the 
					        client was supplied a simple guide of how to use the new branding effectively.

					        The strategy of three landing pages is kept as the site condenses with smaller displays. The 
					        ever-present floating navigation ensures visitors are able to quickly find a product that suits
					        their needs.
					    </p>
					    
					    <p>
					        While the site has only recently been launched, the bounce rate has dropped and the time spent
					        viewing individual pages has increased - considering the client has been fully booked for July
					        this is a great sign for the future.
