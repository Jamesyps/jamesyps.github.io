What gets me out of bed in the morning? The chance to learn something new. I love waking
up, getting in the car and finding a new adventure - especially if I can bring my
camera. I am often found taking walks around the coast of the UK, taking in museums and
art galleries or enjoying a relaxing break in the garden.

Photography is my second love after developing. My D-SLR has been by my side on trips to
the top of Ben Nevis, the cold beauty of Finland and Estonia and the greenery of the
british countryside. You can nd many of my shots on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jamesyps) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/jameswigger/).

When inside, I am either watching movies, playing with digital design or making a
delicious mess in the kitchen.
